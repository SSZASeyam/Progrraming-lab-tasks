1. Define a function named fact() to calculate factorial of a number n and then 
write a program that uses the return value of function fact() to calculate 
combination and permutation. 
2. Define a function which will find the biggest, smallest and average value form
an array and search for a specific value.
Hint: Create a function with two parameters, first one is a array and second one is the 
value that we want to search. Call the function like: function_name(arr, 2) . we will 
pass the array named arr and the value to the function. Inside the function we will 
search for 2 and find the biggest, smallest, and average from the arr.
In the main function we will take input to store the value to the array named 
arr. Then call the function. 
3. Create functions to find the gcd and lcm of two nonnegative integer values and 
to return the result 
4. Write a function to swap the value between two number using call by reference.
5. Write a C++ Program to find Prime Numbers between two numbers. C++ 
program to find prime numbers between 1 and n. 
Hint: call the function with two argument for example: function_name(1,10). It will 
find the prime numbers between 1 to 10
